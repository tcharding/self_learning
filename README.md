This tree contains source code I have written (also in some cases source code
downloaded from text book website) whilst learning the craft of
programming. Categorized by text book name (or abbreviation thereof). I have
attempted to attribute all source files that were typed directly from texts to
their respective authors in the first line of the code. Attribution is generally
given in the source files only (not the header files). However, many files
contain lines of code, or whole functions, taken directly from a text. This has
been done on the path of knowledge and, I believe, is within the spirit with
which the texts were written.

I owe a debt of gratitude to the authors of these texts for having the
opportunity to learn from them. Many thanks.
